## React app with rollup

This demonstrates the rollup setup to bundle react app.
Rollup configurations are: [rollup.config.js](./rollup.config.js)


To test run:
- Clone this repo
- `yarn install`
- build an app: `rollup -c rollup.config.js` or `yarn build` this would generate a bundle `dist/index.js`
- serve an app: `node serve.js`
- visit `localhost:8080`
